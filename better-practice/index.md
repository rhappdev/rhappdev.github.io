## The Better Practice Initiative

### Our Objectives
* Create reusable pieces of work
* Share & Learn from previous experiences
* Define an opinionated development approach

### Our Guiding Principles
* A self-managing, peer-driven community
* For all consultants, not just developers
* Identify what we believe best practice should be
* Minimal documentation (initially)
* Measure where we are as individuals and projects, honestly, so we can see what our next steps should be, in order to move closer towards best practice
* Small steps forward
* Sounding board for individuals to ask the community for thoughts on a pressing need
* Safe place to present a topic of interest

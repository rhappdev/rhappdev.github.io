## Contribute to Workgroups

## Creating a Workgroup
- Check existing Communities of Practice (CoPs), to see if there is already work going on in the area, if there is, consider looping in with that instead
- If a new Workgroup is needed, add your Workgroup in the list above and give it a purpose/objective
- Create Issues in https://github.com/rhappdev/rhappdev.github.io to cover any features, plans, bugs, suggestions etc.
- Tag Issues with Labels
- Create a Milestone in GitHub for your Workgroup, in order to group any Issues related to your Workgroup

## Simple Rules for all Workgroups
Let's make it easy for people to move between Workgroups and contribute. 
Some simple rules will help us do that:

- Individuals select/create the workgroups they are interested in
- Each workgroup must have at least one leader (it can have more)
- Leaders manage & communicate within their Workgroups in whatever way they choose
- Create GitHub repos for your work and repo specific issues/bugs should live there
- Next steps per workgroup should be outlined here https://github.com/rhappdev/rhappdev.github.io as Issues
- Contributions should be done via PRs
- Recommendations, questions, bug reporting, future plans, should be done via Issues in their respective repos
- Repo specific details/changes should live in your own repos (as you could have more than one per workgroup e.g. client/cloud)
- Workgroup specific details (spanning possibly multiple repos) should live in [github.io](https://github.com/rhappdev/rhappdev.github.io)
- Labels should be used to link Issues to pillars
- Individual leaders drive the workgroups and should aim to keep it focused on delivering useful assets for the greater team
- Someone from each Workgroup should give an update at the wider Better Practice meetings, in order to share/learn to/from the wider group
